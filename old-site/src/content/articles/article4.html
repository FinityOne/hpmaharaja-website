          The world is ever-evolving, and with this change comes a change in
          humans - their behavior, perspective, and most importantly, their
          action patterns. Karma is a pattern, and whatever action is taken, an
          equal but opposite reaction is applied. The crazier the action, the
          craizer the result is. With today's generation showing lower and lower
          attention spans, the world has become even more unpredictable when it
          comes to human behavior action. We take a deeper look in this article
          at the intricacies of the modern world, and how it compares to the old
          world. The comparison is ultra-important to analyze because it serves
          as a baseline for understanding how the basic of changes has affected
          the outcome and living quality for the average human being.

        Before delving into these complexities, it is crucial to establish a
        "gold standard"—a guiding principle for what humans should strive to
        achieve on this planet. The highest quality of life should cultivate
        genuine happiness and harmony, both internally and externally within
        society. This article explores how modern society is drifting away from
        these core values and how lessons from the past can offer guidance for
        the future.

          Money: A Shift in Purpose
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          The way money was moving in the old days versus how it moves today has
          a direct impact on our lives. Let's start with the old times: Money
          was a means to an end, and not the end. The whole purpose of why money
          was created was so that people are able to establish a basic baseline
          for trade of goods and services. When the gold standard was around,
          there was a sense of backing for the money, and people weren't going
          crazy for pieces of paper because they knew that the money was backed
          by the mineral that was both rare and limited. When a resource is tied
          to something rare and limited, that is when true value is considered
          and honored, which was prevalent in the older times. Money being
          limited ensured the focus was on the actual good or service. This
          empowered individuals to focus on their craft and serving the world
          through their skill set regardless of how menial or significant the
          skill and product was. Society with a balance of trade, skills, and
          product generation (manufacturing) focused on the core necessities of
          humans yields better results when it comes to quality of life. Gender
          roles were clearly defined, and that ensured full clarity on who was
          responsible for what, which is optimal for wasting no time in debate,
          and moving society forward. When it comes to money, the man was the
          provider, and the woman would act in a support capacity empowering the
          man to go out into the world and gain money for himself and his
          family. Overall, money was viewed as a means not an end, and with
          society operating around service, an understanding that money is
          worthless without a solid backing, and clearly defined roles, it
          provided balance in society to gaurantee to some degree happiness and
          harmony for every individual in society.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          However, today, money has become the ultimate goal rather than a
          facilitator. The obsession with wealth accumulation has distorted
          perspectives on success and purpose, prioritizing short-term financial
          gains over long-term societal well-being.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Money is no longer just paper. It has become the object of everyone's
          conversation, purpose, and tied outcomes! All you hear about in
          everyone's purpose is tied to money, and this mindset has moved
          everyone's purpose from something of value to something that is
          exactly what it is - just paper! Today, there is less backing for this
          piece of paper, and while it may weigh less than an ounce, it weighs
          heavily on the minds of every individual on this planet! How crazy is
          that! Money is a driving factor, but with influence and power, the
          value of money has been masked with a fake sense of "ownership".
          Social media has expedited this view of money like no other, and the
          wrong perspective is therefore fast-tracked to the susceptible mind.
          Instead of focusing on the craft, the focus has shifted to taking
          shortcuts, and making money with the least amount of value delivered.
          This is a clear indicator for society on a whole delivering less
          value, and more imagination that moves society in the reverse
          direction. The aptitude for humans to do more has almost
          instantaneously vanished due to the false promise of a quick dollar!
          This has ruined happiness and harmony for society with the wrong
          alignment of money and it's role in society at the individual level.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Gender roles play a big part in enabling a society to move in the
          right direction in terms of growth, cohesion, and remaning
          foundationally strong! Today, these gender roles are so blurred when
          it comes to money. I heard something recently, that in the old times,
          because the women in society were less-educated, it enabled the man to
          take lead and control to move in an emotionally stable way, but today,
          the over-education and lack of understanding/acceptance of proper
          gender roles has brainwashed everyone of where humans should place
          money and it's effects. The women is chasing money, and the man is
          chasing money, but one does it for the family, and another does it out
          of a selfish motive. It is clear who is doing what for what when it
          comes to money! It is natural for women to seek a man that is
          financially stable, and there is nothing wrong with that, but if the
          balance of money and control of which is off, then a relationship
          between a man and a women sours. The "matrix" has successfully
          braindwashed society that money should be the core focus of both
          genders, and therefore the pain and after effects is felt within the
          society while the higher system imposers who sold this vision are
          benefiting from higher costs for everything enslaving society in the
          name of "freedom". The "matrix" is winning, and unless people wake up
          to the fact that they are just slaving, our socity will continue to
          plummet as we know it!
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          As a final point of modern money, long-term satisfaction has been sold
          to short-term gratification! The endurance of individuals to withstand
          long periods of pain is nearly zero. This degradation of mindset and
          low appetite for long-term planning and gain has corrupted society!
          Money buys your morning coffee, and you're willing to sell your soul
          to Starbucks for it. Make it make sense. Stop slaving!

          Human-to-human Connection Gaps: Family & Social Network
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          This is probably the sadest when it comes to human connection. The
          greatest gift of god is the gift of human life that is designed with
          complexity and the opportunity for connection with social empowerment
          for society to connect, build, and grow loving relationships with each
          other. Today, we are wasting this gift.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          In old times, humans honored human connection as the highest form of
          social currency. People would talk, communicate face-to-face, and form
          a genuine understanding and connection with others within society.
          This form of interaction was and is the best as it delivers all of
          human emotion, intention, and moreover, vibe which cannot be
          replicated with any other form of communication. There were no
          calendars, and people had and made time to prioritize human
          connection. Whether it was family, friends, or just neighbors, there
          was more understanding, support, and harmony in society because of the
          time, effort, and care put into human connection. This is where
          loyalty also sprung from, and being a good human includes being able
          to integrate without friction.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Today, everything is running on a calendar, people have excuses
          stating they are too "busy". It is almost a given excuse that people
          utilize at will with no reprecussion. The lack of attention to human
          connections leaves more gaps, misunderstandings, and the open window
          for friction. People are busy doing nothing, wasting more time than
          ever, and yet still are under the impression that they are doing
          something of value. It is the greatest scheme to exist, and it is
          slowly draining individuals and making them into zombies. Society is
          busy doing absolutely nothing. Prove me wrong!
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Social media destroyed real human connection. The level of distraction
          has not only taken priority off of real human face-to-face connection,
          but also serves as an outlet for skewed perspectives to mold people's
          view on what is real connection and what is fake. I have come across
          many individuals who are constantly engaged into social media,
          entirely consumed by that image of human connection without
          reciprocity, not realizing that the social media creator is
          programming your brain to reject real human connection. It's an
          indefinite circle of distraction and loss of human connection that
          keeps society in a racket.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Dating & Loving Relationships are ruined. Dating is harder than ever,
          and anyone will tell you that. It isn't because of the fact that good
          people don't exist, it's because our tolerance, committment to
          long-term outcomes, and flexibility to adjust with the right
          connection is at an all time low. Both men and women are picky, too
          engaged in the wrong priorities, and missing the mark on what real
          connection means. The merging of gender roles, the perspectives on how
          society should look like, and the constant struggle in tough economic
          and psychological endavors continues to make dating and relationship
          building difficult.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Family life is ending! The union of humans for ages has been to
          procreate and create a family life of stability, growth, and
          development. This family focus has lost track in light of individual
          hyper-independence. The aptitude for sacrifice has almost gone
          missing, and the complexity of mindsets continues to make the world
          more and more difficult to live in for future generations.
          Self-centered mindsets also don't help the situation.

          New Connection Pitfalls
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          The more and more technology that is introduced into society, the less
          and less real connections we are forming. Our mind, soul, and
          intelligence is wrapped up into making digital connections, but our
          hearts crave more real physical, emotional, and mental connections
          with other humans.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Advancements in technology are great, and the illusion is that it
          makes life easier, but rather, in most cases it makes life more
          complicated. The designers of technology such a phones, social media,
          and other advancements are motivated by money, so they place human
          impact as a last concern. It has gotten to a point today that people
          are so engrossed in their "tech" jobs that their main focus is to get
          more people involved, engaged, and technologically drowned. There is
          minute consideration for the impacts of their work, and even if it
          crosses their mind, it is an afterthought to the damage that they do.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          This is a major pitfall in society because people start focusing more
          and more of thier time on technology and less and less time on real
          true meaningful humane connections.

          Environmental Concerns
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          The environment for which you are surrounded by makes a significant
          impact on how your view, action, and behaviours are shaped. If you're
          in the right environment surrounded by the right people, the right
          things will happen to your life. But, if you're in the wrong
          environment with the wrong people, things can start going south and
          bad really fast. It is much easier to pull people down, than to build
          people up, and most people WILL take advantage of that.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          In the older times, people were focused on building core relationships
          with trustworthy and loyal people. They were highly selective on who
          was let into their groups, and if there was a bad apple in the group,
          it was cut immediately. This promotes healthy growth focused energy
          within society that sets a high bar for standards and expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Nowadays, this has flipped on its head. Because of rapid expansion,
          and the merging of massive influx and outflux of people, cultures,
          traditions, and so much more, the original intent to focus on good and
          cleanse out the bad is gone. There are way too many blurry lines
          between what is bad and what is good, and most people will have low
          bars set leading to lower outcomes. You get what you put in, and the
          effort has lacked in today's society.

          Having a higher power inspiration is imperative to lead life in the
          right direction. In the old times, faith was taken very seriously, and
          the words and actions of people were lined up in sync. The focus
          towards a high power ensures that society moves in a synchronous way
          with an equilibrium.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm py-4">
          Nowadays, that has been blurred because of so many deeprooted
          brainwashing programs especially amongst the youth, that people are
          believing new things every day. There is no consistency or
          reliability, and without a fear of the higher power (so the speak),
          people have gotten derailed.

          Regardless of the past, the present is what we have, and our future
          depends on it. The best course of action to do at an individual level
          is to learn from the past, apply some core principles that align with
          your core philosophies in the present moment, and be optimistic about
          the future. Saying, thinking, or believing things won't solve the
          long-term impact problem. Therefore, there is a heavy emphasis on
          action. Taking action to separate yourself with a unique identity with
          a critical yet compassionate lens will help you navigate the world
          with more clarity. This clarity in turn will yield better outcomes in
          your life. I don't have action steps for you, but start with doing an
          introspective search and analysis of the world, and how you would like
          your future to be, knowing the dangers of modern society. Navigate
          around these dangers, and exercise a high level of caution at each
          step to ensure you aren't being engulfed by so-called "good"
          initiatives that have long-term bad outcomes for your life. Be
