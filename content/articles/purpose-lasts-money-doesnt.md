# Purpose Lasts! Money Doesn't.

> In a world of massive monetary transactions, the purpose you operate from is the real asset.

## Money Is Constantly Flowing

Money is constantly flowing around the world, and to put things into perspective, if every person on the planet spends **$5 in a day**, then the volume of transactions is **$41 billion changing hands per day**. This is probably just the cost of a coffee, and people end up spending a lot more than that — but this gives you a solid idea of how much money is flowing globally.

This flow is also an avenue for individuals, businesses, and corporations to accrue more value. **Opportunity is immense — but at what cost?**

With this much money circulating, the average person’s limiting mindset reduces ambition to something like “$100k a year,” which — when compared to $41 billion per day — is **0.00024% of that global daily coffee transaction.**

The point here isn’t to convince you that you can make more money (even though you absolutely can), but to show you that **money is constantly flowing**, and it changes hands faster than you can fathom.

## Purpose Is Deeper

So then you ask yourself:

**“How does money flow *through* me, and how do I paint a bigger story about who I am?”**

The answer is **purpose**.

Without purpose:

- your life feels incomplete  
- you lose potential financial flow  
- you disconnect from your place in the bigger picture of Earth  

*Purpose gives direction, identity, and meaning — and people follow meaning.*

> *The more people learn, understand, and align with your purpose, the more financial flow you will have in life.*

## Purpose Is More Valuable Than Money

When you have a purpose, it naturally attracts the right people. They see your passion, your work ethic, and your commitment — and they want to join that mission.

As more individuals gravitate toward your purpose, **more financial flow channels through you**. That money then becomes fuel to accelerate the mission even further.

> *Without pure intent, you won’t be changing a thing.*

## It’s a Cycle

The cycle of acquiring financial flow and enhancing your purpose is **never-ending** — as long as you keep the wheel moving.

Momentum is built through:

- consistent creation  
- self-alignment  
- discipline  
- conviction  

We are finite beings; our time ends.  
But the **impact created through purpose becomes legacy**.

## The Future

The future is bright — and today you have the power to shift your wheel of purpose and financial flow.

Take small, consistent steps.  
Be willing to take bold risks that align with who you truly are.  
Money will follow purpose — not the other way around.

> *I’ll have to write another article on finding your purpose — a journey that is complicated and truly never-ending.*
