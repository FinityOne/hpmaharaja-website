**Money is constantly flowing**

---

<br>

Money is constantly flowing around the world, and to put things into perspective, if every person on the planet spends $5 in a day, then the volume of transactions is $41 billion changing hands per day! Of course, this is probably just the cost of a coffee, and people end up spending a lot more than that, but that should give you a solid idea on how much money is flowing around the world! This flow is also an avenue for individuals, businesses, and corporations to acrue more value! Opportunity is immense, but at what cost?

<br /><br />

With this much money flowing, the average person's limiting mindset degrades their thinking that the goal should be $100K per year - which put into the perspective of daily transactions is 0.00024% of the daily $5 coffee transaction around the globe - again DAILY! So, why limit the mindset to money when there is so much to look forward to? This example is not made in order to convince you that you can make more money, although that could be the case, but rather that money, in essence, is always flowing, and changes hands faster than you can fathom. <br /><br />

**Purpose is deeper**

<br>

So, then you come to the point at which, you ask yourself, how does money flow more through you, and how can you paint a bigger story about yourself? The answer is purpose. Without a purpose, your life is incomplete, and not only do you miss out on the possibilities of having more financial flow, but you also lose yourself in the bigger picture of Earth. Purpose dictates a way of life for which you align yourself to, and that purpose drives your action, thoughts, and interactions. It also evolves you into a more relatable person within your social circles, who can identify, resonate, and relate with you and your purpose.

_The more poeple learn, understand, and align with your purpose, the more financial flow you will have in life!_

**Purpose is more valuable than money**

---

<br>

Where does money fall into the picture then? Well, when you have a purpose, it will attract the right individuals to join your purpose seeing your passion, hard work, and committment to consistently work on your purpose. The attraction of more individuals will attract the financial flow of money through you, afterwhich you can dictate and move the funds towards progressing your purpose in life!

<br>

_Without pure intent, you won't be changing a thing!_

<br>

**It's a cycle**

---

<br>

The circle of acquiring financial flow (money), and enhancing your purpose is a never ending cycle for as long as you keep the wheel moving! You have to build enough momentum with the things you build while constantly fueling the fire of your purpose. Because we are finite human beings, there will be an end to this life, and depending on the work and impact you have created (at whatever scale), you will leave a resultant legacy!

<br>

**The Future**

<br>

The future is bright, and you have the power now to change the wheel of purpose and financial flow, so take small steps, but consistent steps, and don't be afraid to take the risks that 100% align with your purpose! The future holds many possibilities, but don't let the money mindset get to your head because money will follow your purpose!

<br>

I will have to write another article on finding your purpose - the journey of which is complicated, and never-ending!
