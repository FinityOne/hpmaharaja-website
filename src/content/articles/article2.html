    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Money is constantly flowing</h2>
    <p class="text-md text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Money is constantly flowing around the world, and to put things into
      perspective, if every person on the planet spends $5 in a day, then the
      volume of transactions is $41 billion changing hands per day! Of course,
      this is probably just the cost of a coffee, and people end up spending a
      lot more than that, but that should give you a solid idea of how much
      money is flowing around the world. This flow is also an avenue for
      individuals, businesses, and corporations to accrue more value!
      Opportunity is immense, but at what cost?
    </p>
    <p class="text-md text-gray-700 mb-6">
      With this much money flowing, the average person's limiting mindset
      degrades their thinking that the goal should be $100K per year—which, put
      into the perspective of daily transactions, is only 0.00024% of the daily
      $5 coffee transaction around the globe. Why limit the mindset to money
      when there is so much to look forward to? This example is not made to
      convince you that you can make more money, although that could be the
      case, but rather that money, in essence, is always flowing and changes
      hands faster than you can fathom.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Purpose is deeper</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      So, then you come to the point at which you ask yourself, how does money
      flow more through you, and how can you paint a bigger story about
      yourself? The answer is purpose. Without a purpose, your life is
      incomplete, and not only do you miss out on the possibilities of having
      more financial flow, but you also lose yourself in the bigger picture of
      Earth.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 italic">
      The more people learn, understand, and align with your purpose, the more
      financial flow you will have in life!

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Purpose is more valuable than money</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      When you have a purpose, it will attract the right individuals to join
      your purpose, seeing your passion, hard work, and commitment to
      consistently work on it. The attraction of more individuals will bring
      financial flow through you, after which you can channel those funds to
      progress your purpose in life.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 italic">
      Without pure intent, you won't be changing a thing!

  <section class="py-8 px-2">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">It's a cycle</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      The circle of acquiring financial flow (money) and enhancing your purpose
      is never-ending for as long as you keep the wheel moving! You have to
      build enough momentum with the things you create while constantly fueling
      the fire of your purpose. Because we are finite beings, there will be an
      end to this life, and the impact you create will leave a lasting legacy.

  <section class="py-8 px-2">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Future</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      The future is bright, and you have the power now to change the wheel of
      purpose and financial flow. Take small but consistent steps, and don't be
      afraid to take the risks that 100% align with your purpose! The future
      holds many possibilities, but don't let the money mindset cloud your
      purpose because money will follow your purpose.

      I will have to write another article on finding your purpose—the journey
      of which is complicated and never-ending.
